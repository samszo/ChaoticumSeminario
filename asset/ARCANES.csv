Nous condamnons donc ces philosophies qui ne cessent de tourner autour des mêmes propositions, celles qui aﬃrment que “tous les corbeaux sont noirs”.

Non seulement il y a des zones d’indécidabilité, des régions où la vérité est quantifiée, mais aussi des espaces où le mode de propagation des vérités n’est pas l’inférence sur des chaînes de propositions vraies, mais des pans entiers résonants entre modèles adéquats. "" p. 184</p>; <p>""Rappelons que dans la théorie de Peirce, il y a trois modes d’êtres ou catégories phanéroscopiques : la priméité, la secondéité et la tiercéité. « La priméité est le mode d’être de ce qui est tel qu’il est, positivement et sans référence à quoi que ce soit d’autre. »68 La priméité est la catégorie du sentiment et de la qualité. A cette catégorie appartient, par exemple, la rougéité, qui est le mode d’être de ce qui est rouge, avant même que dans l’univers quelque chose fût rouge69, mais aussi « certaines qualités sensibles comme la valeur magenta, l’odeur de l’essence de rose, le son d’un sifflet de locomotive, le goût de la quinine »70. « La secondéité est le mode d’être de ce qui est tel qu’il est par rapport à un second, mais sans considération d’un troisième quel qu’il soit. »71 C’est la catégorie de l’expérience, de la lutte, du fait et de l’existence. « Dire qu’une table existe, c’est dire qu’elle est dure, lourde, opaque, sonore, autrement dit qu’elle produit des effets immédiats sur les sens, et aussi qu’elle produit des effets purement physiques, attirée par la terre (autrement dit, qu’elle est lourde), réagit dynamiquement contre d’autres choses (autrement dit, qu’elle a une force d’inertie), résiste à la pression (autrement dit, qu’elle est flexible) »72. Enfin « la tiercéité est le mode d’être de ce qui est tel qu’il est, en mettant en relation réciproque un second et un troisième. »73 La tiercéité est la catégorie de la pensée et de la loi. Elle met en relation un premier et un second. Si une paire de dés amène cinq fois de suite un double six, cela ne veut pas dire que la fois suivante un double six sortira de nouveau, mais que le résultat même s’il est actuellement inconnu sera toutefois déterminé. « Ce mode d’être qui consiste, et je dis bien consiste, dans le fait que les faits futurs de la secondéité revêtiront un caractère déterminé, je l’appelle tiercéité. »74"" p. 73</p>; <p>""Si le pouvoir est inscrit dans la topologie des lieux, le savoir est plus fondamentalement, par delà la complexité des relations et l’entrelacement des devenirs, l’émanation première d’un lieu où s’origine le diagramme."" p. 7</p>; <p>""Un topos a une logique intuitionniste qui se réduit à une logique classique si le topos est booléen. Le lieu précède le sens."" p. 8</p>; <p>""Une des conséquences de la théorie mathématique des catégories est que la logique est déterminée par le topologique. Ce qui compte désormais n’est pas la proposition, mais le lieu, le topos qui a sa propre vie organique et qui impose ses modes de raisonnement. Par défaut, la logique immanente d’un topos est intuitionniste : le tiers exclu n’est plus valable, ni le mode&nbsp; de démonstration par l’absurde. Lorsque l’axiome du choix est vériﬁé, ou de manière équivalente lorsqu’il existe une structure topologique particulière des ensembles inﬁnis, alors le théorème de Diaconescu pose que le topos est booléen et que sa logique est classique. Cette logique aboutit le plus souvent à un partage sans autres perspectives entre des propositions qui se résolvent par tautologies pour prolonger des axiomes initiaux et des propositions fausses qui les contredisent. Dans tous les cas, classique ou non, le topologique précède le logique. L’ontologie n’est plus placée sous la dépendance de la logique, mais du topologique. Cette instance ouvre la voie à une nouvelle description de la topologie de l’Être ou onto-(po)-logie. Le but de toute ontologie est une théorie des catégories"" p. 183</p>; <p>""Une fois des catégories posées, elle joue le rôle moderne de ce qu’on appelait autrefois l’analogie ou la similitude, non pas en donnant simplement des rapports de ressemblance ou de convenance, mais en précisant par le biais de foncteurs ce qui de l’une des catégories se trouve dans l’autre, avec des objets comparables, des propriétés et des relations similaires et un mode de fonctionnement identique."" p. 13</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Deleuze mettra en avant la notion (diagramme) pour en faire le critère qui lui permettra de différencier trois grandes voies de l'art moderne. La peinture abstraite élabore moins un diagramme qu'un code symbolique, suivant de grandes oppositions formelles. Dans l'Expressionnisme abstrait, le diagramme envahit tout est devient le tableau lui-même. Également critique de ces deux voies, Bacon en invente une troisième.

"AYW2K7WG","book","2020","","Conspiracy Theories: Philosophers Connect the Dots","","978-0-8126-9479-6","","","","Conspiracy theories have become a major element in modern opinion formation. From the theory that the killing of President Kennedy was masterminded by a powerful conspiracy to the theory that 9/11 was an inside job, from the story that Barack Obama wasn’t born in America to the story that Donald Trump was a Russian asset, conspiracy theories have become a major element in opinion formation and an ever-present influence, sometimes open, sometimes hidden, on the daily headline news. In Conspiracy Theories, philosophers of diverse backgrounds and persuasions focus their lenses on the phenomenon of the conspiracy theory, its psychological causes, its typical shape, and its political consequences. Among the questions addressed: ● What’s the formula for designing a contagious conspiracy theory? ● Where does conspiracy theorizing end and investigative reporting begin? ● What can we learn about conspiracy theories from the three movie treatments of the Kennedy assassination (The Parallax View, JFK, and Interview with the Assassin)? ● Does political powerlessness generate conspiracy theories? ● Is conspiracy theorizing essentially an instinct that lies behind all belief in religion and all striving for a meaningful life? ● Can we find conspiracy theories in all political movements for centuries past? ● What are the most common types of fallacious reasoning that tend to support conspiracy theories? ● Is there a psychological disorder at the root of conspiracy theories? ● Why is the number of flat-earthers growing?","2020-01-07","2020-11-17 18:39:31","2020-11-17 18:39:31","","","256","","","","","Conspiracy Theories","","","","","Open Court","Chicago","English","","","","","Amazon","","","","","https://www.amazon.com/Conspiracy-Theories-Philosophers-Connect-Dots/dp/0812694791","","","Greene, Richard; Robison-Greene, Rachel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Agents d’interfaces ou personnages de jeux vidéo et d’univers ludiques, ces figures anthropomorphiques occupent un rôle de plus en plus important dans les interfaces numériques qui prolifèrent. Dans les univers imaginaires du cinéma, les personnages de synthèse mettent en jeu la question du réalisme de la représentation. Ils remplacent l’acteur humain ou encore ils interagissent avec lui en tant que partenaires, en créant de saisissants effets de présence. Dans les jeux vidéo, les figures de synthèse adoptent une apparence humaine et simulent le comportement du vivant. Dans les mondes en ligne du cyberespace, les avatars et acteurs virtuels remettent en question l’identité et la sociabilité. Ils transforment les arts de fiction, tout comme les modalités opératives des interfaces interactives. En effet, leur mode performatif place l’expérience au centre de l’action du sujet, il augmente ses puissances d’agir.  À travers ces avatars ou acteurs virtuels se tracent les enjeux de la présence médiatisée par les technologies ainsi que de la coprésence, soit la présence partagée dans un nouvel espace de socialisation. Par leur intermédiaire, les mondes en ligne et hors ligne s’interpénètrent pour façonner des réalités hybrides. Comment les avatars, personnages et acteurs virtuels interviennent-ils dans les différents univers numériques ? En interagissant avec nous ou en transportant nos multiples identités, comment affectent-ils notre expérience et notre engagement dans le cyberespace ainsi que notre relation au monde ? De quelle manière génèrent-ils de nouvelles formes de performativité ainsi que des effets de présence ? Ce sont quelques questions que posent les auteurs de cet ouvrage.","2013","2020-12-11 20:55:48","2021-06-26 21:04:27","","","348","","","","","","Esthétique","","","","Presses de l’Université du Québec","Ste-Foy","fr","","","","","","","","","","","virtuel; cyberespace; identité; médiatisation; Avatar; Axe 2; Puissances du faux, stratégies de tromperie et désinformation dans l’écosystème socionumérique; Présence; acteurs virtuel; sociabilité","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Porté par le travail remarquable etla belle collaboration de Renée Bourassa (Université Laval, Canada), Lucile Haute (Université de Nîmes et EnsAD Paris, France) et Gilles Rouffineau (École Supérieure d’Art et Design Grenoble-Valence, France), nos trois rédacteurs·rices en chef invité·e·s, le dossier à thème de ce numéro 08 explore les devenirs numériques de l’édition et le rôle spécifique que le design y joue ou peut y jouer. Ce numéro entend donc faire la part belle à ce design parfois oublié qu’est le design éditorial (terme plus courant en France) ou design d’édition (terme plus courant au Québec), dont chacun ressent tous les jours les effets dans ses expériences de lecture ou d’écriture – qui sont de plus en plus numériques. Le design éditorial, soulignent nos rédacteurs·rices en chef invité·e·s dans leur texte d’ouverture, fait appel « tant au design de connaissance qu’au design d’information, au design d’expérience et au design graphique », c’est une activité qui « remodèle les contours de l’espace éditorial pour en façonner les objets ». Par conséquent, poursuivent-ils, « le design d’édition dessine un champ d’action qui met en question tant les modes de productions éditoriaux pour les designers, que les modes d’écriture et de lecture pour les auteurs et les publics ». Voilà un domaine de recherche et de créativité remarquable qui mérite hautement d’être encouragé et de se développer.","2018","2020-12-11 20:55:48","2021-06-26 09:51:19","","","","8","","","","","PUF","","","","","","fr","","","","","","","","","","","Design; Axe 3; Éditorialisation, humanités et cultures numériques; Édition numérique; Espace éditorial; Expérientialité","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this comprehensive and readable book–already a classic statement of the aesthetics of digital media, acclaimed by practitioners and theorists alike–Janet Murray shows how the computer is reshaping the stories we live by. Murray discusses the unique properties and pleasures of digital environments and connects them with the traditional satisfactions of narrative. She analyzes the dramatic satisfaction of participatory stories and considers what would be necessary to move interactive fiction from the formats of childish games and confusing labyrinths into a mature and compelling art form. Through a blend of imagination and techno-wizardry, Murray provides both readers and writers with a guide to the storytelling of the future.","1998-08","2020-12-11 20:55:56","2020-12-11 20:55:56","","","","","","","","","","","","","MIT Press","Cambridge, Mass","Anglais","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Produits, Outils et Méthodes (H2PTM) http://elliadd.univ-fcomte.fr/pages/f...​ Traitement vidéo : Bastien Marchand Production De l’Intelligence artificielle vers l’apprentissage profond  Avec les machines on peut imiter/simuler une partie des mécanismes conscients du processus de pensée qui sont traduits en algorithmes. On peut qualifier d’intelligent ce type de processus seulement avant de le convertir dans un algorithme, car après, il s’agit plus d’un travail monotone, répétitif, stupide. Le terme d’ #intelligenceartificielle​ (IA), qui date de 1955 (John McCarthy), ressemble plus à une appellation marketing qu’à une définition scientifique. En effet, l’intelligence ne peut pas être artificielle. « Pas plus que la logique, ou le vol. Le vol des avions imite celui des oiseaux, mais on ne parle pas de vol artificiel » (Yann LeCun, p. 153).  Conçues de manière à simuler l’intelligence humaine, toutes les formes de l’IA ne sont rien de plus que cela : de la simulation (le « jeu de l’imitation » comme disait Alan Turing - « Computing machinery and intelligence », Mind, 1950). Afin de créer une IA, Turing propose de commencer avec un noyau de base (« the child program ») et le faire évoluer, le former à devenir adulte faisant appel aux mutations, à l’aléatoire et aux essais-erreurs (« the education process » sur  la base des processus de récompenses ou de punitions). C’est justement l'apprentissage automatique (#machinelearning​) qui assure l’évolution du noyau, l'amélioration de ses performances par expérience. L’apprentissage en profondeur (#deeplearning​) est une technologie qui facilite ce processus. Si avec la transformation de l’IA en artefacts « intelligents » on constate une augmentation de nos capacités d'action, on signale en revanche une diminution des efforts intellectuels et des responsabilités. L’avènement d’une société de la connaissance où l’IA est abondante pose de nombreuses questions éthiques et politiques.

Peut-on retrouver le temps de l’innocence ? Le temps du plaisir archaïque ? Rien n’est moins sûr… Les avancées technologiques de l’intelligence artificielle vont rendre la réalité de plus en plus difficile à distinguer, notamment dans le domaine de la vidéo où « l’hyper-trucage » bouleverse notre relation aux images. La désinformation, qui touchait jusque-là essentiellement les écrits est entrée depuis peu dans une nouvelle ère où il est maintenant possible de manipuler n’importe quelle vidéo en changeant leur sens, leur propos et leur porté. Le vol d’identité Sur des sites sordides d’Internet, des célébrités se retrouvent en acteurs de scènes pornographiques (une pratique nommée Revenge porn). Leurs visages sont littéralement découpés et collés sur des corps nus. La technique est si parfaite que l’on y croit. Le trucage se remarque que de très près, mais ces manipulations numériques se perfectionnent très rapidement avec le risque d’envahir irrémédiablement notre sphère privée1. Une autre pratique consiste à « permuter » des visages. Cette technique étant essentiellement utilisée dans le domaine de la politique pour détourner un message à des fins de propagande.

Apparus aux États-Unis en 2004 et utilisés depuis de façon équivalente, ces néologismes désignent plus particulièrement une culture politique au sein de laquelle les leaders politiques orientent les débats vers l'émotion en usant abondamment d'éléments de langage et en ignorant (ou en faisant mine d'ignorer) les faits et la nécessité d'y soumettre leur argumentation, ceci à des fins électorales. Les formules « ère post-vérité » et « ère post-factuelle » se sont répandues en 2016 lors des campagnes du référendum sur l'appartenance du Royaume-Uni à l'Union européenne, et de l'élection présidentielle américaine. Pour avoir été employée 20 fois plus que l’année précédente, la première est consacrée mot de l'année 2016 par le dictionnaire d’Oxford,. Celui-ci définit ainsi le néologisme « post-vérité » :  « qui fait référence à des circonstances dans lesquelles les faits objectifs ont moins d’influence pour modeler l’opinion publique que les appels à l’émotion et aux opinions personnelles. » Elles sont employées non seulement aux États-Unis et au Royaume-Uni mais aussi en Australie, en Inde et dans les pays où sont développés l'information en continu, le faux équilibre médiatique et les médias sociaux,,,,. En France, le mot est fréquemment utilisé par les commentateurs politiques dès 2016, au point d'entrer l'année suivante dans le Petit Larousse et le Robert illustré. The Economist avance que « la Russie est sans doute le pays qui est allé le plus loin dans la post-vérité, tant en politique étrangère qu’en politique intérieure ». Mais c'est aux États-Unis qu'en 2017 le phénomène suscite des réactions non pas seulement dans les médias mais au sein de la population, lors de différentes manifestations. La même année, et également aux États-Unis, le terme deepfake (hypertrucage) est introduit pour exprimer l'idée qu'à l'avenir, les actes catégorisés ""post-vérité"" ne se limiteront plus à de fausses informations écrites et à des photographies trafiquées et que, de plus en plus, des vidéos seront entièrement détournées, le niveau technique devenant si perfectionné que tout effet de trucage deviendra imperceptible. Les anglo-saxons confèrent au phénomène une origine quasi exclusivement politique (les Anglais et les Américains parlent de post-truth politics et les Allemands de postfaktische Politik) quand les pays latins utilisent simplement l'expression ""post-vérité"" (posverdad en espagnol, post-verità en italien et pós-verdade en portugais) pour signifier que les origines et/ou les conséquences du phénomène débordent le cadre politique.

David; Grusin, Richard A.","Remediation: Understanding New Media","","978-0-262-02452-5","","","","A new framework for considering how all media constantly borrow from and refashion other media. Media critics remain captivated by the modernist myth of the new: they assume that digital technologies such as the World Wide Web, virtual reality, and computer graphics must divorce themselves from earlier media for a new set of aesthetic and cultural principles. In this richly illustrated study, Jay David Bolter and Richard Grusin offer a theory of mediation for our digital age that challenges this assumption. They argue that new visual media achieve their cultural significance precisely by paying homage to, rivaling, and refashioning such earlier media as perspective painting, photography, film, and television. They call this process of refashioning ""remediation,"" and they note that earlier media have also refashioned one another: photography remediated painting, film remediated stage production and photography, and television remediated film, vaudeville, and radio.","1999","2021-02-05 16:42:33","2021-02-05 16:44:01","","","295","","","","","Remediation","","","","","MIT Press","Cambridge, Mass","","","","","","Library of Congress ISBN","P96.T42 B59 1998","","","","","","Mass media; Technological innovations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cependant, l’angle d’attaque sera légèrement différent de celui des autres contributions à ce recueil, qui analysent, à plusieurs égards, le parallélisme entre les nudges et la théorie sémiotique de la manipulation. Convaincu de ne pouvoir ajouter rien de nouveau à ce qui a déjà été affirmé, nous avons choisi de prendre un chemin « oblique », de ne pas traiter directement des nudges, mais d’en évaluer le rôle, la portée et les contours sémiotiques à travers un objet d’analyse qui en sera le « prétexte » : le phénomène des fake-news. Plus précisément, il s’agit de mettre en circuit ces deux pôles thématiques (nudges et sémiotique), en m’inspirant des lieux théoriques les moins discutés jusqu’à présent – d’un côté la théorie cognitive à la base de la proposition des nudges ; de l’autre le problème des passions en sémiotique – le tout par le biais d’un objet d’étude, le phénomène des fake-news, qui semble pouvoir les réunir. Le choix des fake-news est principalement dû à deux raisons : la première est liée à l’actualité du débat qu’elles soulèvent, la deuxième – plus personnelle – concerne mes lectures sur ce thème qui ont motivé mon intérêt pour le projet consacré aux nudges. 1. Présentation de l’objet Le débat sur les fake-news a été ouvert, grosso modo, au lendemain des élections présidentielles aux États-Unis en 2016, et du référendum sur l","-1","2021-03-02 15:46:36","2021-03-02 15:46:36","2021-03-02 15:46:36","XX-XX","","","124","","","Nouvelles formes du faire-croire","","","","","","","fr","CC BY-NC-ND 4.0","","","","www.unilim.fr","","Last Modified: 2021-01-11 18:56:09 Publisher: Université de Limoges","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Matrice et empreinte à la fois, elle semble illustrer le thème de l&apos;&quot;auto-identité absolument contradictoire&quot;. A cela rien d&apos;étonnant puisque [...] tant la chôra que le basho relèvent du monde sensible, non du monde intelligible. Inversement, la notion de topos, dans la mesure où elle concorde avec la logique de l&apos;identité du sujet, relève moins de la sensibilité que de l&apos;intelligibilité.&quot; p. 232</p>; <p>&quot;Il est illégitime [...] d&apos;appliquer au sens des choses les techniques d&apos;analyse du sens développées à propos des signes linguistiques. Une telle approche n&apos;est pas seulement partielle ; elle est fausse dans son principe, car elle commet l&apos;erreur de prendre la carte pour le territoire. Le signe de la chose n&apos;est pas la chose, et une sémiologie ne peut donc pas expliquer les choses. Or les choses ont du sens.&quot; p. 188</p>; <p>&quot;Il y a cependant, pour ce faire, une voie moins directement violente ; et c&apos;est celle que, dans l&apos;ensemble, a suivie la modernité : supprimer le chôra qui, ontologiquement, est nécessaire à la genisis ; autrement dit, neutraliser le déploiement des lieux singuliers de l&apos;écoumène au bénifie d&apos;un espace universel.&quot; p. 105</p>; <p>&quot;L&apos;échelle, c&apos;est en effet ce qui apporte la grandeur de l&apos;édifice non seulement à la taille humaine, mais aux réalités sensible. Cela n&apos;est pas le cas de la proportion qui réfère la forme à elle-même ou à d&apos;autres formes relevant d&apos;un même système, lequel peut être totalement abstrait.&quot; p. 97</p>; <p>&quot;l&apos;écoumène est une relation : la relation à la fois écologique, technique et symbolique de l&apos;humanité à l&apos;étendue terrestre.

L&apos;écoumène, c&apos;est nécessairement cela mais aussi et non moins nécessairement, le déploiement existentiel qui se poursuit en chaque être humain, et qui de ce fait a toujours excédé la définition géométrique des corps.&quot; p. 17</p>; <p>&quot;L&apos;horizon de l&apos;univers n&apos;est pas celui de nos paysages ; mais on peut dire au moins qu&apos;il est celui de notre raison : nous n&apos;avons pas moyen de voir ni de penser rationnellement au delà. En particulier c&apos;est l&apos;horizon de notre science ; laquelle [...] est radicalement incapable, en tant que physique mathématique, d&apos;objectiver complètement l&apos;univers, puisqu&apos;il s&apos;agit d&apos;un étant singulier, à la fois unité et totalité, qui ne peut être mis en relation avec rien d&apos;autre que lui-même.&quot; p. 128</p>; <p>&quot;La raison trajective, elle est en effet dans la pulsation existentielle qui, par la technique, déploie notre corps en monde sur la terre, et qui simultanément, par le symbole, reploie le monde en notre chair. Ainsi le corps et la terre, par le monde et par la chair, font l&apos;unité de l&apos;existence humaine (lgP/lgS) et de l&apos;écoumène (lgS/lgP), dans le moment structurel de leur médiance : (lgS/lgP)/(lgP/lgS). Voilà qui n&apos;était concevable ni dans les termes de la modernité (lgS), ni dans leur inversion (lgP).&quot; p. 402</p>; <p>&quot;Le topos du crayon, nous dirait Aristote, c&apos;est son contour immobile. Celui-ci le borne, autrement dit circonscrit son être. Dans cette définition affleure la conception aristotélicienne de l&apos;identité des choses, qui a fondé en Occident la logique du tiers exclu.&quot; p. 145</p>; <p>&quot;notre appréhension des choses participe au déploiement d&apos;un monde, au lieu de ne prendre sens que dans un arrangement de signes. Les anciens appelaient ce déploiement le poème du monde.&quot; p. 8</p>; <p>&quot;Son milieu ; à savoir le tissu relationnel au sein duquel le crayon existe, et sans lequel il n&apos;existerait pas.&quot; p. 146</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

En douze chapitres concis destinés aussi bien aux curieux qu'aux porteurs de projets, il présente les bénéfices et les enjeux du numérique pour les études littéraires, des usages d'un catalogue de bibliothèque aux analyses de big data, en passant par les nouveaux modes de lectures qu'inspirent les éditions en ligne et le brassage des corpus opéré par les bases de données. Exemples à l'appui, la réflexion démontre le rôle fondamental des interfaces : parce qu'elles transforment notre rapport aux textes, aux livres et à leurs auteurs, elles constituent l'apport décisif des humanités numériques à la littérature.","2019-04","2021-03-02 14:58:50","2021-03-02 14:58:50","2020-11-17","","","","","","","","Focus","","","","Livreo Alphil","","fr","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cette écriture &quot;méta&quot; n&apos;appose plus - ou plus seulement - des signes sur une page ou même sur un écran, mais sur des flux de données numériques [...] Elle sera capable de générer et de régénérer à volonté le graphe fractaloïde hypercomplexe de concepts formels qui enserreront de leur filet régulier la masse énorme des informations.&quot; p. 115</p>; <p>« Chaque nœud de la sphère sémantique IEML est au centre d&apos;une multitude de chemins de transformation calculables. Le long de ces chemins de transformation chaque « pas » d&apos;une carrefour à l&apos;autre est la variable d&apos;une fonction discrète. Pas à pas et de proche en proche, ces chemins relient chaque nœud à l&apos;ensemble immense des autres nœuds. Dans la direction centrifuge, un nœud est donc l&apos;origine singulière d&apos;une étoile de transformation qui génère la sphère. Dans la direction centripète, un nœud fonctionne comme un point de fuite universel de la sphère, puisqu&apos;il existe un chemin de transformation calculable qui mène vers lui à partir de n&apos;importe quel autre nœud. » p. 50</p>; <p>&quot;Connectées par les relations sémantiques de leur concepts et les relations sensibles de leur percepts, les idées échanges leur affects et s&apos;organisent en écosystèmes. On peut analyser les idées en trois composantes interdépendantes : 1) une donnée sensible, ou percept (T), 2) un affect (B), 3) un concept (S)&quot; p. 202</p>; <p>&quot;Considérons donc une division de la nature en trois strates : celles des phénomènes, dans l&apos;hémisphère Sud ; celle de l&apos;esprit humain, dans la zone intertropicale ; celle des symboles, au Nord.&quot; p. 58</p>; <p>&quot;D&apos;un côté, un groupe de transformation symbolique hors du continuum spatio-temporel. disons : quelque chose comme l&apos;éternité. De l&apos;autre côté, un tourbillon de changement pris dans des processus cycliques de naissance, de métamorphose et de mort : le temps fuyant, les moments éclatés de la génération et de la corruption.&quot; p. 70</p>; <p>&quot;dans l&apos;approche ici proposée, tous les univers de formes (tous les systèmes symboliques) ont la même légitimité et ils sont à la fois source et destination des flux d&apos;information qui &quot;montent&apos; et &quot;descendent&quot; les degrés de l&apos;échelle de complexité naturelle.&quot; p. 71</p>; <p>&quot;Dans le modèle de l&apos;esprit qui adopte la sphère sémantique comme système de coordonnées, une idée se représente par une unité d&apos;information sémantique [...]. Le concept se code par un USL [...] qui est automatiquement converti en circuit de la sphère sémantique et traduit en langues naturelles. L&apos;affect se code par un courant sémantique (polarité, intensité) coulant dans ce circuit. finalement, le percept [...] est adressé par un URL.&quot; p. 305</p>; <p>&quot;Dés lors, tôt ou tard, l&apos;implantation informatique &quot;libre&quot; et l&apos;usage collaboratif de la sphère sémantique IEML nous permettra de relever trois grands défis de l&apos;augmentation cognitive : celui de la modélisation scientifique de la cognition symbolique, celui d&apos;un perfectionnement de la production collaborative de connaissance à partir des données du Web et finalement celui d&apos;une augmentation des capacités personnelles autonomes d&apos;organiser ses apprentissages et de naviguer dans les flux d&apos;information.&quot; p. 51</p>; <p>&quot;Deux notions transdisciplinaires essentielles au paradigme informationnel émergent des travaux de ses fondateurs : la forme et la différence. L&apos;information comme forme est indissociable d&apos;une constellation où elle s&apos;associe au notion de code, de transmission, de traduction, de bruit et de redondance. Quant à l&apos;information comme différence, elle fait sens dans un réseau sémantique où les concepts d&apos;opération, d&apos;opérateur et de transformation jouent les rôles principaux.&quot; p. 66</p>; <p>&quot;Du coté de la Terre, l&apos;objectivité pratique d&apos;un monde matériel et, du coté du Ciel, la nécessité existentielle d&apos;une monde de significations et de valeurs.&quot; p. 83</p>; <p>&quot;En effet, nous sommes aujourd&apos;hui fort loin de disposer du médium symbolique [...] qui nous permettraient de tirer le meilleur parti des conversations créatrices distribuées qui accumulent leurs mémoires sur le Web. Le problème est triple. Il tient à la transversalité des personnes par rapport aux communauté, à la transversalité des communautés eu égard aux environnements numériques et à la transversalité des savoirs relativement aux différentes mémoires accumulées par les communautés.&quot; p. 109</p>; <p>&quot;Finalement, coupant le plan d&apos;immanence de l&apos;équateur cosmique, le codage symbolique connecte et traduit l&apos;un [pôle Sud] dans l&apos;autre [pôle Nord] 1) le monde de la complexité phénomènale qui monte des organismes et 2) l&apos;univers en expansion des singularités sémantiques, l&apos;écosystème des concepts, le temps virtuel des chants et des récits qui occupe l&apos;hémisphère Nord.&quot; p. 78</p>; <p>&quot;Finalement, la connaissance actuelle ne peut se séparer des consciences où elle se reflète au présent et des processus d&apos;apprentissage individuels d&apos;où elle part et où elle revient. Cette dimension subjective de la connaissance ne peut évidemment par être &quot;gérée&quot; comme une chose ou une situation objective par une quelconque autorité extérieure. Elle relève du for intérieur, c&apos;est-à-dire du désir d&apos;apprendre et de partager, du travail sur soi des individus ou de la discipline autonome des personnes.&quot; p. 100</p>; <p>&quot;Il est désormais socialement et techniquement possible de mettre sur pied une discipline scientifique holistique, critique et réflexive dont l&apos;objet - observable ! - serait la circulation générale et les transformations réglées de l&apos;information signifiante au sein des communautés humaines.&quot; p. 130</p>; <p>&quot;Il existe donc une quantité d&apos;USL distincts qui excède de plusieurs ordres de grandeur le nombre de particules élémentaire de l&apos;univers physique connu. Il y a suffisamment de place, semble-t-il, dans le métalangage IEML pour que toutes les significations puissent s&apos;exprimer.&quot; p. 48</p>; <p>&quot;Il faut considérer l&apos;Hypercortex comme le grand projet d&apos;observatoire des humanités et des sciences sociales, comparable aux cyclotrons des physiciens ou aux agences spatiales de la conquête de l&apos;espace.&quot; p. 215</p>; <p>&quot;je commençais à concevoir un langage dont les expressions se présentaient sous la forme d&apos;enveloppes contenant des enveloppes et ainsi de suite récursivement ou &quot;fractalement&quot;.&quot; p. 39</p>; <p>&quot;je propose une première étymologie hypothétique selon laquelle, dans une con-versation, les personnes se tournent les unes vers les autres et échangent périodiquement le sens des flots discursifs qu&apos;elles s&apos;adressent. Selon ma seconde étymologie hypothétique, la conversation serait un processus de con-version du savoir implicite vers un mode explicite et vice versa, cette conversion réciproque se faisant &quot;ensemble&quot; (cum).&quot; p. 106</p>; <p>&quot;L&apos;effort considérable qui était déployé pour accéder aux sources primaires n&apos;étant plus nécessaire, le centre de gravité des chercheurs s&apos;est déplacé et porte maintenant presque exclusivement sur l&apos;interprétation - de plus en plus automatisée - des données, ainsi que sur la conversation critique avec les chercheurs qui exploitent le même corpus.&quot; p. 128</p>; <p>&quot;L&apos;enjeu scientifique est le suivant : l&apos;utilisation de modèle d&apos;intelligence collective animal est-elle suffisante pour rendre compte de la cognition symbolique dans des contextes culturels ? Je pense que non.&quot; p. 95</p>; <p>&quot;L&apos;essence de ma proposition est de considérer la noosphère sur le fond d&apos;un système de coordonnées qui rendrait ses transformations descriptibles par des fonctions calculable.&quot; p. 81</p>; <p>&quot;L&apos;être humain ne peut vivre une expérience (phénoménale) quelconque sans lui donner sens.&quot; p. 93</p>; <p>&quot;L&apos;étymologie donne donc : &quot;sphère de l&apos;intellect&quot;, sphère du nous&quot;. L&apos;univers sémantique - la noosphère de Teillhard - désigne le lieu de l&apos;interdépendance symbolique des activités propres à l&apos;espèce humaine [...] la noosphère fait croître autour de la biosphère - et en interdépendance avec elle - une couche de complexité évolutive encore plus rapide et créative que celle de la vie organique.&quot; p. 80</p>; <p>&quot;L&apos;idée de base est relativement simple : il n&apos;existe pas de symboles isolés ni de symboles &quot;en soi&quot;, et aucun objet d&apos;expérience ne fonctionne comme symbole s&apos;il n&apos;est interprété dans le cadre, la grille de lecture ou la &quot;grammaire&quot; d&apos;un système symbolique donné.&quot; p. 62</p>; <p>&quot;L&apos;intelligence collective humaine (le dialogue des milieux d&apos;expérience) engendre et connecte les deux moitiés du symbole naturel : elle plonge &quot;en-bas&quot; dans le pôle de l&apos;interaction matérielle au moyen de son expérience sensible, ancrée dans les corps et, au-delà, dans l&apos;interdépendance biosphèrique ; elle rejoint &quot;en-haut&quot; le pôle intelligible de la sphère sémantique par sa capacité collective de manipulation des signe.&quot; p. 85</p>; <p>&quot;La cognition symbolique humaine se présente comme un opérateur étrange qui connecte et enveloppe réciproquement les idées et les phénomènes. Or cette boucle passe aussi entre les individus puisque les systèmes symboliques sont aménagés par la culture et que les phénomènes que nous expérimentons quotidiennement sont coproduits socialement.&quot; p. 93</p>; <p>&quot;La conception de ces jeux peut en effet être considérée comme un art ou si l’on veut, une “sagesse” au service de l’augmentation durable de la puissance cognitive de communautés de joueurs.&quot; p. 353</p>; <p>« La démarche scientifique contemporaine ne considère en général comme information que ce qui est défini comme tel pour un système symbolique donné pris comme modèle d&apos;une situation ou d&apos;un environnement. Dès lors, seuls certains traits des phénomènes sont considérés comme pertinent – et sont donc comptés comme information – et cela uniquement dans la mesure où ces traits se présentent comme configuration particulières du système symbolique pris comme modèle. » p. 62</p>; <p>&quot;la notion d&apos;écologie cognitive que je concevais comme une émergence auto-organisée à partir d&apos;un mixte de possibilités biologiques, de formes culturelles, de réseaux sociaux et de technologies intellectuelles.&quot; p. 30</p>; <p>&quot;La nouvelle frontière se trouvait désormais dans l&apos;intériorité cognitive de notre espèce.&quot; p. 23</p>; <p>&quot;La première différence est que l&apos;individu humain a non seulement des capacités remarquables de résolution de problèmes mais aussi et surtout [...] une conscience réflexive, qui lui est conféré par la pensée discursive, que le discours qui sous-tende sa pensée soit intérieur ou dialogué. [...] Ils [les animaux] ne se figurent pas eux-mêmes dans le miroir de leur propre discours. [...] La seconde différence est que l&apos;intelligence collective humaine se déploie, d&apos;une génération à l&apos;autre, dans le cours d&apos;une histoire ou d&apos;une évolution culturelle; [...] Contrairement à l&apos;intelligence collective animale, l&apos;intelligence collective humaine apprend non seulement à l&apos;échelle d&apos;une génération dans le temps ou d&apos;une société dans l&apos;espace, mais également à l&apos;échelle spatio-temporelle beaucoup plus vaste de l&apos;espèce humaine dans son ensemble.&quot; p. 96</p>; <p>&quot;La substance correspond au noyau ou à la membrane la plus intérieur de l&apos;enveloppement [...] L&apos;attribut correspond à la strate intermédiaire de l&apos;enveloppe. Finalement, [...] le mode. Il correspond à la peu extérieur de l&apos;enveloppe ou du repli sémantique.&quot; p. 36</p>; <p>&quot;Le cycle de la gestion personnelle des connaissances [...] La gestion de l&apos;attention [...] Le choix des source [...] Le rassemblement, le filtrage, la catégorisation et l&apos;enregistrement des flux d&apos;information [...] La synthèse, le partage et la conversation [...] Le bouclage réflexif de la gestion personnelle des connaissances&quot; p. 101</p>; <p>&quot;Le dictionnaire fonctionne comme un &quot;programme sémantique&quot; de tissage de la sphère [...] qui actualise les potentialités de la machine computationnelle qu&apos;est la syntaxe du métalangage.&quot; p. 50</p>; <p>&quot;Le dictionnaire fonctionne comme un &quot;programme sémantique&quot; de tissage de sphère&quot; p. 50</p>; <p>&quot;Le médium numérique est aujourd&apos;hui balkanisé par la concurrence des plates-formes commerciales, les difficultés de la traduction automatique entre langues naturelles et par la foule de systèmes de métadonnées et d&apos;ontologies incompatibles. Mais la sphère sémantique pourrait transformer le médium numérique en une mémoire perspectiviste, une monadologie herméneutique où les conversations créatrices pourront s&apos;entr&apos;interpréter librement et collaborer efficacement sans renoncer à leurs points de vue originaux.&quot; p. 212</p>; <p>&quot;Le monde des corps matériels et celui des significations immatérielles doivent donc être saisis dans l&apos;unité d&apos;une nature informationnelle qui les connecte par le milieu de l&apos;expérience humaine. [...] Toute la complexité des processus naturels s&apos;étend entre ces deux pôles, entre ces deux espaces-limite, entre l&apos;espace-temps relativiste de la &quot;matière-énergie&quot; et l&apos;immense réseau fractaloïde de la sphère sémantique qu&apos;explore la capacité discursive humaine.&quot; p. 84</p>; <p>« Le mot « symbole » vient du grec symboleon et signifie étymologiquement « tenir ensemble » […] Le mot renvoie également à la coutume (grecque, ici encore) de casser un tesson de poterie en deux morceaux, et de munir d&apos;une morceau chacun deux sujet qui auront à se reconnaître dans le futur. » p. 79</p>; <p>&quot;Le prix Nobel 1998 d&apos;économie, Amartya Sen explique que le développement humain ne peut être réduit à la croissance du produit national brut et à l&apos;ouverture des marchés. Il doit aussi prendre en compte tous ces &quot;biens&quot; qui ne sont pas directement inclus dans le circuit monétaire tels que : les valeurs éthiques, esthétiques et sociales, les libertés personnelles et collectives ou la qualité de l&apos;environnement.&quot; p. 117</p>; <p>&quot;Le processus cognitif d&apos;interprétation des textes en langues naturelles repose largement sur la capacité à identifier des unités textuelles emboîtées récursivement.&quot; p. 274</p>; <p>&quot;Le rapport entre la sphère sémantique et l&apos;Hypercortex se présente donc comme une relation entre un instrument scientifique d&apos;observation (l&apos;hypercortex) et le système de projection qui l&apos;organise (la sphère sémantique)&quot; p. 205</p>; <p>&quot;Le rôle de la sphère sémantique est de mettre en cohérence un tel mouvement au service de l&apos;augmentation du Cortex&quot; p. 205</p>; <p>&quot;Le symbolisme donne bien accès aux rouages de la machinerie cognitive, mais seulement sur la scène du monde phénoménal, c&apos;est-à-dire sous le voile révélateur du signifiant. Le phénoménal renvoie au neuronal. Le neuronal à l&apos;organique, l&apos;organique au moléculaire et le moléculaire au particulaire. En transcodant les objets de l&apos;univers sémantique dans le monde phénoménal et vice-versa, la cognition symbolique humaine connecte l&apos;ouverture infinie des opérations de catégorisation à toutes les couches antérieures de la nature informationnelle.&quot; p. 77</p>; <p>« le système de notation des nombres par position [...] permet une interprétation universelle et univoque du sens de chaque chiffre en fonction de la place qu&apos;il occupe dans une expression. Le concept correspondant à la séquence des chiffre (le nombre) peut donc se déduire automatiquement de cette séquence. » p. 316</p>; <p>&quot;Le Web forme sans doute un hypertexte mais il s&apos;agit d&apos;un hypertexte opaque, fragmenté entre langues, classifications, ontologies et plate-formes commerciales, un hypertexte dont les noeuds ne sont en fin de compte que des adresses physiques. Si nous voulons utiliser le Web pour coordonner nos intelligences collectives et partager nos mémoire culturelles à une nouvelle échelles ; si nous voulons nous représenter plus clairement qu&apos;aujourd&apos;hui les opérations de nos processus de cognition sociale, repérer les zones aveugles de nos savoirs et augmenter nos capacités de questionnement critiques ; si nous voulons avancer vers une meilleure intercompréhension culturelle et cultiver l&apos;efficacité de nos conversations créatrices ; si nous voulons enfin démultiplier nos capacités de construire et d&apos;interpréter les récits à support numérique en utilisant la puissance de calcul disponible, alors il nous faut compléter le médium numérique par une nouvelle couche d&apos;adressage et de calcul sémantique.&quot; p. 324</p>; <p>&quot;Leibniz, qui fut bibliothécaire pendant quarante ans, fut donc confronté professionnellement aux problèmes concrets de la gestion des catalogues de plusieurs bibliothèque. il est sans doute le premier philosophe et scientifique à penser rigoureusement le problème de la classification des connaissances en rapport avec l&apos;organisation des bibliothèques.&quot; p. 111</p>; <p>&quot;Les figures et textures de l&apos;expérience phénomènale se succèdent séquentiellement - une par une - mais cette succession s&apos;accompagne invariablement d&apos;opérations de distinction et de comparaison entre les formes, qui se détachent donc toujours sur un fond de durée et de mémoire.&quot; p. 73</p>; <p>&quot;Les symboles sont des objets abstraits - et non des choses concrètes - précisément parce qu&apos;ils appartiennent à des système symboliques plutôt qu&apos;à l&apos;univers matériel. Cela n&apos;empêche pas que les symboles doivent s&apos;inscrire dans le monde matériel, ne serait-ce que pour être perçue.&quot; p. 62</p>; <p>&quot;Même si de grands philosophes comme Spinoza et Leibniz ont à l&apos;époque pensé rigoureusement l&apos;unité de la nature, la révolution scientifique du XVIIe siècle est restée inachevée : au plan technique de la modélisation mathématique, la nature conçue par la science, parce qu&apos;elle n&apos;inclut pas la culture, c&apos;est-à-dire l&apos;intelligence collective humaine structurée par des systèmes symboliques, est encore incomplète et fragmentée.&quot; p. 124</p>; <p>&quot;Même si tous les objets et toutes les données de la connaissance humaine ne sont pas symboliques, ils sont tous symboliquement recodés, intégrés et traduits par des systèmes de mesure, des images, des récits et par une foule d&apos;institutions culturelles en général.&quot; p. 82</p>; <p>&quot;Multipliable à volonté ou pointable par hyperliens dans l&apos;environnement numérique ubiquitaire, c&apos;est-à-dire présente partout, l&apos;archive n&apos;est donc plus d&apos;abord adressée dans l&apos;espace physique mais dans la sphère sémantique impalpable ; c&apos;est son sens, ou sa pertinence pour des lecteurs, qui constitue désormais son adresse principale. L&apos;adressage fondamental passe d&apos;un ordre physique (la cote des fiches de bibliothèque) à un ordre sémantique. Or cette première mutation en entraîne une autre : la possibilité de varier indéfiniment l&apos;adressage sémantique d&apos;un document selon les points de vue et les usages.&quot; p. 114</p>; <p>&quot;nous participons à plus d&apos;une communauté culturelle. Si nous considérons ces communautés sous un angle cognitif, elles se constituent par un processus autopoïétique de construction, de reproduction et de transformation d&apos;écosystème de savoirs.&quot; p. 100</p>; <p>&quot;On notera que la dialectique virtuel /actuel est elle-même indissociable de la dialectique signe / être /chose/ En effet, seule la cognition symbolique, parce qu&apos;elle est réflexive, peut distinguer entre - d&apos;une part - l&apos;actualité concrète des corps et des événement inscrit dans le continuum spatio-temporel et - d&apos;autre part - la virtualité des possibilités, abstractions, concepts et idées envisagées par l&apos;esprit.&quot; p. 204</p>; <p>&quot;Parce que nous pensons et que nous communiquons au moyen de symboles, et qu&apos;un symbole connecte une sensation à une idée, chaque instant de pensée relie un complexe phénoménal (un entrelacs d&apos;images sensori-motrices) à un complexe sémantique (des rapports entre concept). Entre le phénomène signifiant et le concept signifié circule un flot d&apos;intensités émotionnelles : l&apos;énergie de liaison. Il n&apos;est pas de cognition sans affect, pas de connexion entre signifiant et signifié sans une force et une qualité de connexion déterminées.&quot; p. 59</p>; <p>&quot;Plus généralement, nous avançons lentement mais surement vers une situation de computation ubiquitaire dans laquelle les capacités de mémoire, de calcul et de communication sans fil sont quasiment illimitées et complètement intégrées à l&apos;environnement ambiant.&quot; p. 129</p>; <p>&quot;Pour bien saisir la nature de la cognition symbolique, deux points ne doivent jamais être perdus de vue. Premièrement, les symboles (les relations signifiants-signifiés) n&apos;existent jamais isolément : ils appartiennent à des ensembles de symboles qui font système : langues, écritures, religions, constitutions politique, règles économiques et ainsi de suite. Deuxièmement, les utilisateurs de ces systèmes de symboles ne sont - eux non plus - jamais isolés : pour exister en tant que systèmes symboliques effectifs, les langues, écritures, religions, constitutions politiques ou règles économiques doivent fonctionner à l&apos;échelle de communautés ou de sociétés qui forment des ensembles culturels.&quot; p. 94</p>; <p>&quot;Sur un plan pratique, l&apos;usage effectif de la sphère sémantique est évidemment subordonné à l&apos;existence de programmes d&apos;indexation qui transforment les données multimédias en provenance du Web en flux d&apos;information dans la sphère sémantique, et qui transforment en retour les dynamiques de courant d&apos;information dans la sphère sémantique en données multimédia interactives.&quot; p. 51</p>; <p>&quot;Un collectif intelligent ou un réseau d&apos;apprentissage collaboratif ne dispose d&apos;une mémoire véritablement commune que dans l&apos;exacte mesure où elle est construite et modélisé par la conversation créative de ses membres dans un médium unificateur.&quot; p. 105</p>; <p>&quot;Un jeu d&apos;interprétation collective fonctionne donc à la fois comme un instrument d&apos;observation et un poste de pilotage entre les mains d&apos;une conversation créatice : un vaisseau virtuel explorant la sphère sémantique.&quot; p. 335</p>; <p>&quot;une configuration symbolique donnée ne représente jamais qu&apos;un codage particulier d&apos;une forme. En effet, la même forme peut être exprimée dans plusieurs systèmes de codage différent.

Menée sur trois continents, une enquête fouillée sur une situation alarmante. C’est un fléau qui touche déjà plus de 430 millions de personnes dans le monde et devrait frapper un adulte sur dix en 2040. Maladie auto-immune pour celui de type 1, liée à la malbouffe et à la sédentarité pour le type 2, le diabète se déclare sans prévenir. Malgré des promesses renouvelées de remèdes miracles depuis la découverte en 1922 du rôle de l’insuline dans la stabilisation du taux de glucose dans le sang, le traitement de cette maladie chronique du pancréas pâtit d’une obsession partagée par la communauté médicale et les laboratoires : celle du contrôle glycémique, qui pousse à accumuler les traitements médicamenteux en négligeant leurs effets secondaires parfois fatals. Les patients sont poussés dans une escalade thérapeutique, qui n’empêche en rien la progression d’une maladie entraînant amputations, cécité et accidents cardio-vasculaires. Alors que les arrêts de travail, les invalidités et le coût des traitements pèsent lourd sur les finances publiques, l'industrie pharmaceutique, elle, continue de prospérer grâce à la maladie : le diabète représente en effet un marché colossal de 46 milliards de dollars annuels. Explosion  Aux États-Unis, le coût élevé des traitements, laissé à la charge des malades, voit nombre d’entre eux privés de soins adaptés ou contraints à des arbitrages douloureux pour les financer. Si, en Allemagne, on commence à privilégier pour les diabétiques de type 2 un sevrage médicamenteux associé à une meilleure hygiène de vie, l’explosion des cas dans un pays comme le Sénégal fait craindre le pire pour l’avenir. Fruit d’une enquête sur trois continents, cet état des lieux approfondi et alarmant donne la parole à des patients, parmi lesquels le musicien Bertrand Burgalat, diagnostiqué à l’adolescence diabétique de type 1 et cofondateur de l’association Diabète et Méchant, ainsi qu’à des experts de la santé, des chercheurs et des médecins.

Nous faut-il inventer un nouveau concept d'homme ? Mais qui croit encore à l'utopie ? Discréditée par le naufrage « totalitaire », méprisée par la gauche comme par la droite, éclipsée par les politiques « pragmatiques », c'est-à-dire néo-libérales, et oubliée par un mouvement altermondialiste qui, dans l'ensemble, se satisferait d'un aménagement plus juste et plus égalitaire du système capitaliste mondialisé, l'utopie semble bel et bien morte.Fredric Jameson ne nous propose nullement une utopie supplémentaire. Cet ouvrage nous invite au contraire à reconsidérer l'utopie en tant que pensée (et pratique) de la Différence radicale. Différence spatiale, d'une part - dès le geste inaugural de Thomas More, l'utopie se voit définir comme un monde séparé obéissant à ses lois propres. Différence temporelle, d'autre part - la mise en place d'une société utopique constituant la négation de l'histoire humaine.Jameson ose chercher du côté de la science-fiction les indices d'une pensée de l'Altérité radicale : Philip K, Dick, H. G. Wells, Ursula Le Guin ou William Gibson sont entre autres convoqués. La littérature dite d'anticipation s'est en effet souvent demandé comment l'on pourrait vivre dans une utopie réalisée, autrement dit dans un monde où il n'y aurait plus rien d'autre à espérer que la perpétuation éternelle du Même.Cet ouvrage majeur nous met finalement face à la faillite de notre imaginaire politique. Car l'oubli de l'utopie a un prix : la résignation au « monde comme il va ».Fredric Jameson, né en 1934, est professeur à l'université de Duke. Il est connu à travers le monde pour ses analyses du postmodernisme et de la colonisation de la sphère culturelle par le capitalisme.","2007-10-25","2021-03-05 16:31:16","2021-03-05 16:42:37","","","260","","","","","Archéologies du futur Volume 1","","","","","Max Milo Editions","","French","","","","","","","","","","","séance03","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, Land's work has continued to exert an influence, both through the British “speculative realist” philosophers who studied with him, and through the many cultural producers—writers, artists, musicians, filmmakers—who have been invigorated by his uncompromising and abrasive philosophical vision.Beginning with Land's early radical rereadings of Heidegger, Nietzsche, Kant and Bataille, the volume collects together the papers, talks and articles of the mid-90s—long the subject of rumour and vague legend (including some work which has never previously appeared in print)—in which Land developed his futuristic theory-fiction of cybercapitalism gone amok; and ends with his enigmatic later writings in which Ballardian fictions, poetics, cryptography, anthropology, grammatology and the occult are smeared into unrecognisable hybrids.Fanged Noumena gives a dizzying perspective on the entire trajectory of this provocative and influential thinker's work, and has introduced his unique voice to a new generation of readers.","2011-04-01","2021-03-05 16:42:26","2021-03-05 16:42:33","","","680","","","","","Fanged Noumena","","","","","Urbanomic/Sequence Press","Falmouth : New York, NY","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2nd ed. edition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dorénavant, les flux de data témoignent de la quasi-intégralité des phénomènes, s'érigeant comme l'instance primordiale de l'intelligibilité du réel. Une connaissance sans cesse approfondie s'instaure, orientant en retour les décisions individuelles et collectives au prisme d algorithmes visant les plus hautes optimisation, fluidification et sécurisation des existences et des sociétés. Les technologies informationnelles imposent un mode de rationalité fondé sur la définition chiffrée de toute situation et sur une maîtrise indéfiniment accrue du cours des choses.

D’une part, les faits sont toujours des facta : même lorsqu’ils correspondent à une réalité attestée, ils ont été constitués comme « faits » par des dispositifs technico-idéologiques (de même que les data sont toujours des capta). Ensuite, les faits sont toujours vu à partir d’un nombre limité de points de vue : c’est la perspective dans laquelle on les voit/place qui leur donne une partie de leur signification. Enfin, la perspective elle-même ne peut conférer du sens qu’à partir d’orientationsgénérales (idéologies), structuratrices de valorisations qui sont toujours culturelles. Il résulte de ces décadrages que « la » vérité au singulier n’a jamais existé parmi les humains, et que la post-vérité est un faux problème, le vrai écueil sur lequel butent nos systèmes (mal-nommés) d’« information » étant avant tout celui de la pertinence. En revanche, les mutations du paradigme indiciaire (avec l’avènement des « deep fake »), la fluidification des reconnaissances d’autorité, et la capacité à assurer des chaines de référentialité fiables sont bel et bien des questions cruciales pour essayer de moins mal comprendre notre présent. Hyperstition, spéculation et complot : schizoanalyse des imaginaires conspirationnistes (Fabien Richert) Cette intervention sera l’occasion de présenter le concept d’hyperstition. Conçu à partir d’une contraction des mots « hyper » (intensité excessive) et « superstition » (fétichisme, surnaturel, force occulte), le concept d’hyperstition est utilisé pour penser le pouvoir suggestif et fantasmatique de certaines fictions et autres composés narratifs qui brouillent les frontières entre le vrai et le faux, la théorie et la fiction. Ces composés narratifs dits « hyperstitionnels » disposent également d’une puissance performative en raison de leur capacité à esquisser de manière plausible des modèles explicatifs de certains phénomènes et événements qui résistent toujours plus ou moins à la compréhension individuelle et collective. Nous reviendrons succinctement sur la généalogie d’un tel concept qui provient d’un ensemble de chercheurs et d’étudiants de l’Université de Warwick. Passionnés par la cyberculture et la French Theory, regroupés autour de la Cybernetic Culture Research Unit (CCRU), ces chercheurs ont notamment participé au développement des thèses très controversées de l’accélérationnisme. À cette allure occulte, ésotérique, voire complotiste qui caractérise leurs travaux, s’articule une tentative de compréhension des dynamiques actuelles et futures du technocapitalisme par l’intermédiaire de théories qui puisent abondement dans les imaginaires catastrophistes, surnaturels et occultes. En nous appuyant sur quelques exemples concrets, et en nous servant du vocabulaire emprunté à la schizoanalyse deleuzo-guattarienne (diagramme, flux, territoire, univers de valeurs) ‒ ayant notamment inspiré les travaux du CCRU ‒, nous testerons la pertinence du concept d’hyperstition pour aborder certains traits caractéristiques de la logique spectaculaire de ce qu’on a proposé d’appeler, faute de mieux, l’ère de la post-vérité.","2021-03-19","2021-03-26 20:14:22","2021-10-20 17:59:56","","","","","","","","Séance #4","","","","","","Montréal","Fr","","","","","","","","","","","enregistrements; séminaire 2021","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1:52:18","","Vidéo MPEG-4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cette présentation traite des différentes phases d’une recherche-action en cours, entamée il y a deux ans, visantl’éducation à l’esprit critique et à la culture numérique. Il s’intéresse plus particulièrement à laconstruction médiatique d’un discours alarmiste - à certains égards proches de la fake news -susceptible de fabriquer des inquiétudes et à la manière dont ce discours peut être réceptionnépar un public de parents. Enfin, nous présentons le projet Polemika qui a pour objectif de créerun habitus de réception des discours alarmistes médiatiques, afin d’aider les citoyens àdévelopper leur lecture critique, en s’appuyant sur l’étude de la nature des émotions ressentieslors de la réception des fake news. Humanisme numérique pour manipuler des connaissances entre confiances intimes et numériques (Samuel Szoniecky) Entre pouvoir de discernement et pouvoir d’agir, nous manipulons nos connaissances avec des analogies qui coordonnent nos perceptions et nos actions. Nous tapons sur nos claviers, nous changeons la vitesse de notre voiture ou nous répliquons à un argument qui nous semble fallacieux, d’autant plus automatiquement que nous sommes confiant dans ces analogies. Nous construisons continuellement depuis notre naissance cette confiance intime qui règle nos rapports intuitifs avec le monde en faisant l’économie de l’analyse, du calcul et de l’argumentation : je le sais parce que je le sens. Mais parce qu’elle s’ancre profondément dans notre intimité, cette confiance est facilement manipulable par des émotions et donc par ceux qui jouent avec elles. A l’inverse, dans le monde du Web sémantique et du LinKed Open Data, la confiance est le résultat d’une construction de rapports formels. Ici plus de place pour l’émotion, seul compte la calculabilité des formes symboliques. Parce qu’elle se base sur des savoirs très techniques, cette confiance n’est pas facilement manipulable par tous mais uniquement par des experts. Dans un monde où la perte de confiance est le symptôme de plus en plus flagrant d’un malaise dans la civilisation, peut-on concevoir un humanisme numérique qui associe confiances intime et numérique pour coordonner collectivement nos perceptions et nos actions ?","2021-03-05","2021-03-26 20:16:23","2021-06-18 14:47:47","","","","","","","","Séance #3","","","","","","Montréal","Fr","","","http://medias.arcanes.ca/seminaire/h21/03-seminaire-arcanes-2021-03-05.mp4","","","","","","","","enregistrements; séminaire 2021","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1:58:37","","Vidéo MPEG-4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study explored some of those reactions: those of host society youth. It examined the process of this youth learning about themselves in the context of the social media propaganda about the resettlement of Syrian refugees, and investigated how the public opinion about the refugee resettlement affected their perception of their roles in the integration and inclusion of these newcomers.   Research questions:  1.How do youth construe online interactions about the Syrian refugee crisis? 2.How do youth construe their role in the integration and the inclusion of refugees in a context where the image of refugees is deeply influenced by social media? 3.What knowledge and skills do youth develop when they engage in analyzing their thoughts and behaviours in regards to sensitive and controversial issues such as the refugee crisis and resettlement? 4.How could this knowledge and these skills facilitate their engagement in civic online reasoning and participatory politics? Methodology:  The researcher conducted more than 160 hours of qualitative in-depth interviews with 42 host society youth between 18 and 24 years old from North America, Europe and the Middle East. For the purpose of this thesis, only data collected from the Canadian participants was analyzed and shared. The participants were recruited through a snowball sampling. They were active on social media, supportive of the Syrian refugee resettlement in Canada, but deliberately acting as passive bystanders whenever they encountered online posts and interactions about the Syrian refugee crisis. Adapting four techniques from George Kelly’s Personal Construct Psychology (Kelly’s self-characterization technique, Procter’s Perceiver Element Grid, Kelly’s Repertory Grid Test and Hinkle’s laddering technique), data collection included three to four interviews with each participant.  The interviews provided the participants with opportunities to delve into their own construct systems and to reflect on the genesis of their constructs.  Results and Conclusions:  By reflecting on their own behaviours online, participants realized that they could control how social media influenced them, and shape the online image of the Syrian refugees in host countries. While their empathy towards refugees increased, participants identified factors that could lead to Islamophobia, racism and fear, and developed strategies to counterbalance them online. The process of learning about themselves was key to transform the participants from passive bystanders into active agents of change, ready to confront digital propaganda. Civic educators, social workers, curriculum developers, policy makers and parents concerned with the takeover of social media by hate speech proponents can apply these findings and help youth withstand manipulation and fight racism, hate speech, radicalization, and cyberbullying through the Get Ready to Act Against Social Media Propaganda model generated by this study. The model includes five iterative stages: Question, analyze, design, prepare and evaluate.","2017-11","2021-03-26 20:03:50","2021-03-26 20:03:50","2021-03-26 20:03:50","","203","","","","","Learning About Oneself","","","","","Concordia University","","en","term_access","phd","","","spectrum.library.concordia.ca","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

(Pascal Martin) Les truquages au cinéma sont concomitants à son invention. Ce n’est certainement pas un hasard si le premier découvreur, Georges Méliès, était prestidigitateur. Les techniques de l’illusion alors utilisées ont mué au gré des évolutions technologiques où les astuces artisanales ont fait place à une industrie à part entière. De grandes périodes se dessinent ; truquages directs à la prise de vue, les trucages en post-production, truquages composites. L’arrivée du numérique a engendré une perfection visuelle, où réel et virtuel se confondent comme jamais. Les visual effects ont succédé aux trucages. Mais au fur et à mesure de ses évolutions, notre regard s’est-il transformé ? percevons-nous les images de la même manière que les générations qui nous ont précédés ? A travers différents exemples, nous tenterons de démontrer que l’approche est plus complexe qu’il n’y parait et que si l’image est polysémique, notre perception elle, est multifactorielle. Le réel « performé » des dispositifs ludiques de téléréalité (Pierre Barrette) Les émissions de téléréalité ont contribué significativement à transformer la manière dont la télévision « produit » de la réalité et « documente » le réel existant, influençant par là-même notre rapport à l’expérience ainsi que la manière dont nous envisageons la vérité des « événements médiatiques ». Au-delà du « mélange des genres » qu’elle suppose sur le plan des effets de surface et du dispositif, la TR doit être étudiée pour ce qu’elle révèle des constructions énonciatives originales qu’elle engage le téléspectateur à produire et des conséquences de celle-ci sur le statut respectif de la fiction, du documentaire et des jeux en contexte de communication télévisuelle.","2021-04-16","2021-04-19 12:17:34","2021-06-18 14:53:11","","","","","","","","Séance #7","","","","","","Montréal","Fr","","","http://medias.arcanes.ca/seminaire/h21/07-seminaire-arcanes-2021-04-16.mp4","","","","","","","","enregistrements; séminaire 2021","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1:54:53","","Vidéo MPEG-4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

L’IA, sur laquelle ils reposent, perfectionne la possibilité de truquer les images et les sons. La technologie étant devenue accessible, la fabrication de deep fakes semble désormais à la portée de tous. Leur multiplication et leur diffusion annoncées sont perçues comme un nouveau facteur de désordre informationnel. En effet, les deep fakes sont un nouvel avatar des “puissances du faux” : ils miment ce qui fait l’authenticité d’un enregistrement audiovisuel tout en brouillant sa référentialité.

De tels récits, actualisés notamment par les révélations d’Edward Snowden en 2013 (l’interception systémique des communications numériques à l’échelle mondiale par les agences de renseignement) ou le scandale Cambridge Analytica (le ciblage de millions d’internautes à leur insu, grâce à une quantité phénoménale de données béhaviorales), sont présents depuis longtemps dans l’imaginaire social, que ce soit à partir d’œuvres de fiction (1984 de George Orwell) ou de traités philosophiques (Le panoptique de Jeremy Bentham). Dans une démarche croisant la sociologie, la littérature et la philosophie de la technique, nous examinerons l’importance que revêt la prolifération des « technologies de surveillance » (permettant au sens large la captation des données comportementales et biométriques) pour la création artistique. Quelles contraintes ces technologies introduisent-elles pour les créateur·trice·s, d’une part, et quelles potentialités artistiques génèrent-elles, d’autre part ?

L’évolution du support d’enregistrement mécanique vers la bande électromagnétique, au milieu du XXe siècle, puis vers des systèmes d’enregistrement numériques, a rendu toujours plus aisée la modification des signaux sonores enregistrés ainsi que la création des sons entièrement de synthèse. Ces procédés se sont généralisés au sein des processus de créations cinématographiques et vidéoludiques, entre autres, afin de donner des identités sonores à des appareils, des créatures, ou des phénomènes physiques fictifs. Mais, dans le contexte exclusivement sonore d’une création radiophonique de science-fiction, comment faire « entendre le futur » ?

Créant des parallèles entre la scène de la magie de la première partie du XXe siècle caractérisée par la révolution électrique et la scène médiatique plus contemporaine chamboulée par l’avènement des pratiques du numérique, le projet SMEL se situe entre l’archéologie des médias et l’expectative de l’intermédialité pour penser l’espace médiatique/numérique d’aujourd’hui autour de l’authenticité et de la médiation. Cette communication énoncera d’abord les objectifs et l’aboutissement de SMEL, puis les raisons de la mutation de cette recherche en ARCANES. Ensuite, elle se concentrera sur les techniques de traitement des sources documentaires employées lors de SMEL pour inventorier le corpus. De la réflexion de l’interopérabilité des données, à l’organisation d’une base de données sémantique jusqu’au premier prototypage d’un dispositif d’éditorialisation, le propos amènera à examiner les expérimentations faites, leurs résultats, et les processus qui nous servent de premières pistes pour penser à l’objectif actuel du développement d’un écosystème de recherche des ARCANES.","2021-04-23","2021-04-23 15:51:40","2021-06-28 22:39:58","2021-04-23","","","","","","","","","","","","","Paris","Fr","","Google Slides","","","","","","","","","Authenticité; Axe 3; Éditorialisation, humanités et cultures numériques; espace liminaire; SMEL; spectacle magique","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Séminaire ARCANES - séance #8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Les bouleversements dans l’accès à une parole publique et dans la médiation des savoirs, couplés à une profonde crise de défiance vis-à-vis des figures et des discours d’autorité, expliquent les mises en circulation contemporaines de ces infox, fabriquées pour tromper et pour défendre certaines visions du monde.","2021-04-23","2021-04-27 14:22:37","2021-06-18 14:54:15","","","","","","","","Séance #8","","","","","","Montréal","Fr","","","http://medias.arcanes.ca/seminaire/h21/08-seminaire-arcanes-2021-04-23.mp4","","","","","","","","enregistrements; séminaire 2021","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1:56:25","","Vidéo MPEG-4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whether it is Ambisonic, binaural or WFS (Wave-Field Synthesis) format, the goal is to reconstruct the shape of the sound wave reaching the ears of a listener, so as to give him the sensation of being facing to a natural sound object. As in virtual reality, the objective is to create the conditions for a sound immersion close to the physical reality of sound.</div> <div class="""">The history of these developments is accompanied by an explicit discourse, advocating the qualities of realism and fidelity to the laws of physics. But these notions mask an ambiguity between the listening situation and the very nature of the content that is offered to the perceiving subject. Several contemporary works offer to hear a material whose existence is intrinsically linked to the diffusion device, and which could not find a counterpart in a ""natural"" listening, outside this sound projection space. What then of these criteria of conformity to a supposed model, to which we could verify the quality of illusion?<br class="""" /> </div> <div class="""">This raises the question of the meaning conveyed by the sounds: is not the narrative diagram of a radio play sufficient to summon the listener to an illusion of a complete immersion in its dramaturgy? Doesn't the spatialization of sound in cinema go against our desire to project ourselves in front of us, amongst actors visually present on the screen? And yet, spatialized musical compositions, immersive and without a frontal image, can be astounding in authenticity, spatial precision and finesse in the sound timbres.<br class="""" /> </div> <div class="""">In this notebook, we are interested in the relationships between the spectator, the artistic and semantic proposal of a sound work and the acoustic proposal of technological evolutions in sound: what requirement of meaning for which technology of diffusion? A sound environment and a narrative discourse do not meet the same perceptual constraints in terms of ecological validity, of referential illusion: what level of perceptual requirement for what technology, for what format of creation? With each proposal, it is the meaning conveyed by the sound and its diffusion technology, it is our ability to project ourselves into the imagination and into our representations in memory, which must guide the appropriate technological choices, and not the other way around.</div> <div class="""">It will therefore be a question of realism, authenticity, illusion, coherence, immersion and spatialization, in an approach that is at the same time philosophical, perceptual and technological.</div> </div> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </th> </tr> </tbody> </table> </td> </tr> <tr class="""" style=""border-collapse: collapse;""> <td class="""" style=""border-collapse: collapse;

Fifty years later, nothing is quite so straightforward. In Event of Moon Disaster illustrates the possibilities of deepfake technologies by reimagining this seminal event. What if the Apollo 11 mission had gone wrong and the astronauts had not been able to return home? A contingency speech for this possibility was prepared, but never delivered by President Nixon – until now. The immersive installation invites you into this alternative history and asks us all to consider how new technologies can bend, redirect and obfuscate the truth around us.","2019","2021-06-09 12:05:09","2022-02-09 14:48:21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Documentaire","","","","","","","","","art; informatique; Deep Fakes; Intelligence artificielle; Manipulation; hypertrucage; Richard Nixon; simulacre; Apollo 11; Deepfake; Vincent Bergeron; Vincent Caron","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitatively evaluation of the generated samples.","2014","2021-06-11 12:38:09","2022-02-09 14:51:36","","2672-2680","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","génératif; modèle; Deep Fakes; Intelligence artificielle; hypertrucage; simulacre; Deepfake; Vincent Bergeron; Vincent Caron","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Digitization, which is primarily understood as a technological phenomenon, is here framed by a focus on the archival actions or gestures of three key groups: those who made use of the documents now in the collection, those whose labour helped to create the archive, and those who put these traces of the past online.

Dans le cadre de cet article, il s’agira de réfléchir à la manière dont les témoignages participent à l’écriture de l’histoire, ainsi qu’à la façon dont il est possible de faire l’histoire des propos tenus par les témoins. Cela conduira à considérer aussi bien la subversion de l’histoire proposée par des auteurs dits postmodernes, que la subversion de cette subversion par le philosophe Paul Ricœur. Pour résumer, on se demandera : comment l’historien peut-il intégrer le subjectif à son récit sans perdre de vue les attendus de sa discipline ? Et quel rôle l’historien peut-il occuper face au surgissement de la mémoire des acteurs de l’histoire ? Comment leur intégration à une forme filmique par un réalisateur peut-elle être interprétée ? Ces réflexions épistémologiques sont ici adossées à l’étude du cas particulier de l’entretien accordé en 1979 par Michael Podchlebnik – l’un des seuls survivants du Sonderkommando du camp d’extermination de Chelmno – à Claude Lanzmann pour Shoah. Pragmatiquement, cet exemple et l’analyse d’autres prises de parole du même survivant en 1945 et en 1961, conduisent à quelques gains d’intelligibilités dans la perspective d’une histoire du singulier prenant en compte la mémoire des individus.","2012-01-01","2021-06-17 19:58:03","2021-06-17 19:58:03","2016-03-29 23:06:49","","","1","27","","","Entre mémoire singulière et histoire du singulier","","","","","","","","","","","","escholarship.org","","Number: 1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fin 1978, après plus de trente années de silence, Karski accepte d’être filmé à son domicile pendant deux jours. Dans Shoah (1985), Claude Lanzmann octroie trente-neuf minutes à ce témoignage. En 2010, le réalisateur a repris l’entretien original pour réaliser un nouveau film, Le Rapport Karski, diffusé sur la chaîne franco-allemande Arte. À vingt-cinq ans d’intervalle, Shoah et Le Rapport Karski ont été perçus comme des documentaires, c’est-à-dire comme des films donnant un accès le plus direct possible aux paroles des témoins. Si, dans les deux cas, le réalisateur affirme son souhait de transmettre la «vérité», tant les propos qu’il a tenus au sujet de ses films que les choix visuels qu’il a effectués diffèrent. Il apparaît ainsi que la transmission de la vérité à laquelle aspire le réalisateur prend des formes distinctes selon le contexte de réalisation et questionne ainsi plus généralement la part de la médiation dans la réalisation d’un film dit documentaire.","2011-05-15","2021-06-17 19:58:03","2021-06-17 19:58:03","2016-03-29 23:10:07","","","27","","","","","","","","","","","fr","Propriété intellectuelle","","","","etudesphotographiques.revues.org","","Number: 27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

L’étude sémiopragmatique menée dans la première partie de cet article n’a conduit ni à une réévaluation de la qualité esthétique des photographies collectées, ni à identifier des aspects particulièrement originaux dans la forme prise par l’interface. Ce constat conduit à considérer que l’intérêt du site Man on Bridge se situe moins au niveau formel, qu’au niveau des fonctionnalités de l’interface et des usages de la part des internautes. Cela mène à adopter six désignations complémentaires (webdocumentaire, documentaire interactif, fonds d’archives en ligne, collection, élément d’un projet transmédia et base de données) de ce site et, ainsi, à trouver un modèle interprétatif adapté à cette forme symptomatique de ce que l’avènement de l’époque du numérique fait à la pratique cinématographique.","2016-01-10","2021-06-17 19:58:03","2021-06-28 12:51:33","2016-03-30 14:18:25","","","12","","","","Man on Bridge","","","","","","","fr","Tous droits réservés","","","","entrelacs.revues.org","","Number: 12","","","","Axe 3; Éditorialisation, humanités et cultures numériques","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ils se situent dans la lignée des êtres artificiels ayant peuplé l’histoire humaine au sein de représentations fantasmagoriques, que ce soit sous forme d’ombres, de doubles ou de spectres ayant le pouvoir de s’animer. En effet, les figures du simulacre jouant sur l’illusion perceptive ou sur les leurres sont aussi anciennes que la faculté de symboliser. Au sein des représentations contemporaines, elles partagent la scène avec l’acteur ou le danseur en chair et en os, par le truchement de projections d’images ou en s’incarnant dans des automates issus de la robotique. Dans les mondes fictionnels du cinéma numérique, ces figures anthropomorphiques relèvent de l’animation de synthèse. Elles agissent à titre de personnages : parfois elles dialoguent avec les acteurs réels, d’autres fois elles les remplacent. Qu’est-ce qui rend présent, performatif et parfois inquiétant un personnage virtuel ? Quel rôle est-il appelé à jouer dans les pratiques artistiques contemporaines des arts de la scène ? Dans le domaine de la danse, les chercheurs explorent le mouvement de ces corps virtuels, désormais dissociés de leur enveloppe charnelle d’origine. Quels sont les procédés scénographiques et médiatiques utilisés pour animer ces personnages et créer un effet de présence ? Quelles transformations esthétiques opèrent les simulations du corps de synthèse ? Le personnage virtuel peut-il vraiment simuler le corps humain dans toutes ses nuances expressives, tant sur le plan de son apparence que de son comportement ?

Comment est-il appelé à se transformer en contexte numérique ? En mai 2018, des chercheurs et des praticiens de tous horizons (design, édition, communication, littérature...) se sont réunis à Montréal lors du colloque ÉCRIDIL afin de  dresser un état des lieux et proposer des pistes de réponse.  Fruit d'une expérience éditoriale menée en parallèle de l'événement, le présent ouvrage est un index fragmenté et   raisonné des notes prises collectivement pendant les échanges. Sa réalisation repose sur des outils   numériques qui engagent une   nouvelle forme de chaîne éditoriale, à   la fois collaborative, hybride et   ouverte dans le temps comme dans   l'espace.

Google, acting without permission of rights holders, has made digital copies of tens of millions of books, including plaintiffs', through its Library Project and its Google books project. The district court concluded that Google's actions constituted fair use under 17 U.S.C. 107. On appeal, plaintiffs challenged the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Google. The court concluded that: (1) Google’s unauthorized digitizing of copyright-protected works, creation of a search functionality, and display of snippets from those works are non-infringing fair uses. The purpose of the copying is highly transformative, the public display of text is limited, and the revelations do not provide a significant market substitute for the protected aspects of the originals. Google’s commercial nature and profit motivation do not justify denial of fair use. (2) Google’s provision of digitized copies to the libraries that supplied the books, on the understanding that the libraries will use the copies in a manner consistent with the copyright law, also does not constitute infringement. Nor, on this record, is Google a contributory infringer. Accordingly, the court affirmed the judgment.","2015","2021-08-07 15:07:07","2022-02-10 13:52:19","2021-08-07 15:07:07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","","États-Unis; droit; Deep Fakes; hypertrucage; Cour suprême; Deepfake; Vincent Bergeron; Vincent Caron; Deep Fake; Deepfakes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2d Cir. 2015","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cour suprême des États-Unis","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The term has roots in the religious tradition of the Indian subcontinent and was subsequently imported into video game terminology during a period of widespread appropriation of Eastern culture by Californian tech industries. We argue that the use of the term was not a case of happenstance but a signaling of the potential for computing to offer a mystical or enchanted perspective within an otherwise secular world. This suggests that the concept is useful in game cultures precisely because it plays with the “otherness” of the term's original meaning. We argue that this indicates a fundamental hybridity to gaming cultures that highlight the need to add postcolonial perspectives to how issues of diversity and power in gaming cultures are understood.","2020-12","2021-08-25 14:01:18","2021-08-25 14:01:18","2021-08-25 14:01:18","962-981","","8","15","","Games and Culture","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Google, acting without permission of rights holders, has made digital copies of tens of millions of books, including plaintiffs', through its Library Project and its Google books project. The district court concluded that Google's actions constituted fair use under 17 U.S.C. 107. On appeal, plaintiffs challenged the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Google. The court concluded that: (1) Google’s unauthorized digitizing of copyright-protected works, creation of a search functionality, and display of snippets from those works are non-infringing fair uses. The purpose of the copying is highly transformative, the public display of text is limited, and the revelations do not provide a significant market substitute for the protected aspects of the originals. Google’s commercial nature and profit motivation do not justify denial of fair use. (2) Google’s provision of digitized copies to the libraries that supplied the books, on the understanding that the libraries will use the copies in a manner consistent with the copyright law, also does not constitute infringement. Nor, on this record, is Google a contributory infringer. Accordingly, the court affirmed the judgment.","","2021-09-25 18:56:01","2022-02-09 14:41:54","2021-09-25 18:55:59","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","<p><span style=""font-size: 13px; color: #000000; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Arial'; font-style: normal; text-decoration-skip-ink: none;"">13-4829 (2d Cir. 2015); demande d’examen rejetée par la Cour suprême des États-Unis.</span></p>","","","bibliothèque; loi; Deep Fakes; hypertrucage; édition; droit d'auteur; copies numériques; Deepfake; Vincent Bergeron; Vincent Caron","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","13-4829 (2d Cir. 2015)","","","","",""

Lim. Copyright in Canada is subject to a number of statutory defences, of which parodies and non-commercial user-generated content (UGC) are but two examples. However, the interface between these defences and the protection of moral rights is not very clearly delineated in Canada’s Copyright Act. The statutory defences appear to immunise a user from liability for traditional copyright infringement but not from claims of moral rights infringement. Under this fragmentary approach, users engaging in acts of fair dealing or in the production of non-commercial UGC might still find themselves vulnerable to attack from author-claimants alleging that their moral rights have been violated. Through a comparative survey of key legislative provisions in Canada and the United Kingdom, this article explores the extent to which Canada can learn from the UK experience, and considers the viability of streamlining the scope of the statutory defences to copyright infringement, in order to clarify the interface between users’ rights, moral rights and economic rights.","2018-08-06","2021-09-27 09:56:48","2022-02-09 12:39:40","2021-09-27 09:56:48","70-102","","1","15","","SCRIPTed","On the Uneasy Interface between Economic Rights, Moral Rights and Users’ Rights in Copyright Law","","","","","","","en-GB","","","","","script-ed.org","","Publisher: Script Centre, University of Edinburgh","","","","Canada; Deep Fakes; hypertrucage; droit d'auteur; Deepfake; droits moraux; droit économique; Royaume Uni; Vincent Bergeron","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In other words, when a machine learns, thinks, and acts without human input, and it creates a work, what person should own the copyright, if any? This Note explains why this is a pressing question and why current laws and practices fail to address the issue. It then analyzes the arguments for and against the possible choices: the artificial intelligence, the user, the programmer, the company that owns the artificial intelligence, and entrance into the public domain. Finally, this Note arrives at the conclusion that the work’s immediate entrance into the public domain is the solution.","2020-11-20","2021-09-27 10:03:19","2022-02-09 12:41:36","","217","","1","71","","","What if Artificial Intelligence Wrote This?","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","<p><span style=""font-size: 13px; color: #000000; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Arial'; font-style: normal; text-decoration-skip-ink: none;"">Voir l’analyse présentée dans: Victor M.

Il n’y a plus guère de domaines du litige civil qui échappent à ces écrits, témoignages et éléments matériels, qu’ils soient sous la forme de courriels, d’enregistrements, de captures d’écran, de fichiers .doc, .pdf, .xls, etc. À titre d’exemple, la jurisprudence illustre de quelle façon le droit du travail, le droit de la famille et les contrats commerciaux sont de plus en plus le théâtre de documents numériques présentés et contestés devant les juges. Cette réalité qui se présentait déjà il y a cinq ans, alors que nous proposions la première édition de cet ouvrage, s’est accentuée lentement mais sûrement pour à elle seule justifier la mise à jour qui apparaît dans cette seconde version. Ces changements factuels ne sont pas les seuls qui justifient cet ajout de près de 25 % de contenu nouveau. Le droit lui aussi a évolué. D’abord, c’est plus d’une centaine de décisions qui sont venues éclairer les dispositions de la Loi concernant le cadre juridique des technologies de l’information et du Code civil du Québec traitant de preuve technologique. Parmi cette jurisprudence qui s’est densifiée récemment, on peut notamment citer un arrêt majeur de la Cour d’appel (Benisty c. Kloda) qui, en avril 2018, répond fermement à plusieurs questions qui n’avaient jamais été abordées jusqu’alors par la jurisprudence. Ensuite, nous devions intégrer le changement d’importance que constitue l’adoption en janvier 2016 du nouveau Code de procédure civile dont l’une des volontés déclarées est de faciliter la preuve et de mieux considérer l’innovation numérique. Enfin, la présente édition souhaite également mieux faire état de la main tendue faite implicitement par la Loi aux normes techniques afin d’objectiver la preuve des documents technologiques.","2018-07-31","2021-09-28 13:04:00","2022-02-09 14:49:06","2021-09-28 13:04:00","","","","","","","","","","","","LexisNexis Canada","","Français","","","","","","","","","","","droit; juridique; loi; Deep Fakes; enregistrements; hypertrucage; documents électroniques; Deepfake; capture d'écran; courriels; fichiers; jurisprudence; litige civil; tribunaux; Vincent Bergeron; Vincent Caron","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2e édition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper we initiate a framework studying what to do when it is no longer permissible to deploy models derivative from specific user data. In particular, we formulate the problem of efficiently deleting individual data points from trained machine learning models. For many standard ML models, the only way to completely remove an individual’s data is to retrain the whole model from scratch on the remaining data, which is often not computationally practical. We investigate algorithmic principles that enable efficient data deletion in ML. For the specific setting of k-means clustering, we propose two provably efficient deletion algorithms which achieve an average of over 100×improvement in deletion efficiency across 6 datasets, while producing clusters of comparable statistical quality to a canonical k-means++ baseline.","2019","2021-09-27 16:47:53","2022-02-09 14:37:44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Vancouver","English","","","","","","","","","","","Deep Fakes; hypertrucage; machine learning; Régulation; Deepfake; computationnel; données; Vincent Bergeron; Vincent Caron","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","33rd Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Josephson-Storm","Journal of Scientific Exploration","","","10.31275/20211959","","We live in a contradictory world. Self-proclaimed “skeptics”, as the original meaning itself suggests, should first of all strive for proper scientific rationality, for reflective and objective distancing in the apprehension of reality, for methodological caution and for the extended ability to theoretical and philosophical understanding of intricate problems, in practice, too often have entrenched themselves in dogmatic groups. Inquisitors often endowed with the appearance of religious fanaticism, in the worst sense of the term, invest their energies in a crusade of attacks to everyone to whom they attribute mistakes, naivety or even bad intentions. In practice, the universe of those who do not fit in their often restricted, idealized and naïve views of scientific practice. With them, there is hardly any possibility of frank dialogue or opening to research fields that escape their conceptions of what science and philosophy can approach and how they should operate. Charlatans, backward, believers, superstitious; these are some disqualifications generally granted to researchers who dare to go beyond the limits they established for science and rationality. To substantiate their certainties, such self-proclaimed skeptics often claim to base their approach to science on the examples given by highly regarded scientists and philosophers of the past. We speak here of scholars of the stature of Giordano Bruno, Francis Bacon, René Descartes, Isaac Newton, the Encyclopedists, Immanuel Kant, Arthur Schopenhauer, Sigmund Freud, James Frazer, the Vienna Circle, Max Weber, etc. Despite their different approaches, we are talking about many of the very founders of modern Western knowledge. The self-proclaimed contemporary “skeptics” claim their inscriptions in the tradition inaugurated by these illustrious intellectual ancestors. They claim to defend with determination such a rationalist tradition against “pseudoscientists” and “mystic-religious"" philosophers who, according to their opinions, wish to corrupt it through insidious insertions in a field that would not rightfully belong to them. This would be their main mission.","2021-03-08","2022-01-11 16:13:46","2022-01-11 16:13:46","","141-154","","","35","","Journal of Scientific Exploration","The Myth of Disenchantment","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Jason Ā. Josephson-Storm argues that as broad cultural history goes, this narrative is wrong, as attempts to suppress magic have failed more often than they have succeeded. Even the human sciences have been more enchanted than is commonly supposed. But that raises the question: How did a magical, spiritualist, mesmerized Europe ever convince itself that it was disenchanted? Josephson-Storm traces the history of the myth of disenchantment in the births of philosophy, anthropology, sociology, folklore, psychoanalysis, and religious studies. Ironically, the myth of mythless modernity formed at the very time that Britain, France, and Germany were in the midst of occult and spiritualist revivals. Indeed, Josephson-Storm argues, these disciplines’ founding figures were not only aware of, but profoundly enmeshed in, the occult milieu; and it was specifically in response to this burgeoning culture of spirits and magic that they produced notions of a disenchanted world.   By providing a novel history of the human sciences and their connection to esotericism, The Myth of Disenchantment dispatches with most widely held accounts of modernity and its break from the premodern past.","2017-05","2022-01-11 16:12:50","2022-01-11 16:13:00","2022-01-11 16:12:50","","400","","","","","The Myth of Disenchantment","","","","","University of Chicago Press","Chicago, IL","en","","","","","University of Chicago Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

L'analyse de ce phénomène à travers la notion de transfiguration de Dilip P. Gaonkar et Elizabeth A.

Moreover, the rhizomatic stratification of such cyberplaces reveals a more nuanced view of meme dynamics, one that takes into account the agency of users as they efface and impose meanings on memes, not unlike the process of deterritorialization enacted on places.","2018","2022-02-23 15:10:41","2022-02-23 15:10:41","2022-02-07 16:14:06","4-18","","1","24","","Space and Culture","Colonizing Pepe","","","","","","","en","All rights reserved","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","Internet; cyberplace; meme; participatory culture; Pepe the Frog; spatiality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We argue that Pepe the Frog and other memes can be interpreted as “cyberplaces” defined as computer environments that display the ideological polemics between netizens as they struggle to build a sense of community. Moreover, the rhizomatic stratification of such cyberplaces reveals a more nuanced view of meme dynamics, one that takes into account the agency of users as they efface and impose meanings on memes, not unlike the process of deterritorialization enacted on places.","2018","2022-02-23 15:10:41","2022-02-23 15:10:41","","135-148","","2","10","","","‘Very much like any other Japanese RPG you’ve ever played’","","","","","","","","All rights reserved","","","","","","","","","","Internet; cyberplace; meme; participatory culture; Pepe the Frog; spatiality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Williams","Indiana Law Journal 1651","","","","https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/ilj/vol94/iss4/9/","This Note examines recent developments in the research of situational video evidence biases. Part I examines the current and growing body of psychological research into the various situational biases that can affect the reliability of video evidence and the gaps in this research that require further attention from researchers and legal academics. Because these biases do not “operate in a vacuum,” Part I also examines some of the recent and exciting research into the interaction between situational and dispositional biases. Part II examines the development of camera and video processing technology and its limitations as a means of mitigating such biases. Part III explains how such research could be used to develop heuristics to better assess the admissibility or presentation of video evidence and the need for greater judicial scrutiny of video evidence. This Note concludes by highlighting the potential research about the situational factors affecting the perception that video evidence has for producing insights useful for practitioners conducting criminal trials and municipalities and police forces adopting video technology, and closes with suggestions for further research.","2019","2022-02-09 20:59:33","2022-02-09 21:06:47","2022-02-09 20:59:33","","","4","94","","","","","","","","","","EN","","","","","","","","<p><span style=""font-size: 13px; color: #000000; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Arial'; font-style: normal; text-decoration-skip-ink: none;"">Théorie selon laquelle une vidéo, une fois authentifiée, parle d’elle-même sans égard à la crédibilité de son auteur.
